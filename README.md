# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed because 
2. No, end-to-end tests are not suitable for checking if a function returns the correct output. Unit tests or integration tests are more appropriate for verifying the specific behavior and output of individual functions within a system.
3. No,Unit testing is not suitable for testing the "message" feature of a messaging application, as it focuses on individual parts of the code rather than the complete feature. End-to-end (E2E) testing is more appropriate in this case as it allows for testing the entire flow of the feature, including user interactions and integration between different components. E2E testing provides a realistic testing environment and ensures the feature functions correctly from the user's perspective.
4.Yes,Unit tests would be appropriate for testing the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests allow for isolating and testing specific functionality, ensuring that the code behaves correctly in restricting the message length to 80 characters. They provide coverage for different scenarios, execute quickly, and act as a safety net during refactoring or maintenance.
